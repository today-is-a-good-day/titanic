# Summary skype call 10.04.2015
 
 
This document summarizes what we agreed on to go on with our Kaggle Titanic competition available under the following 
[link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted).
 
Here are the to-do´s:
- Download the data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/data) and get familiar with it. 
- Look at submissions and get inspired (some have been published in the [forum](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/forums))
- Do some explortatory data analysis/visualization/plots. Some visualizations can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/prospector#208), but we should do our own to ge a first idea of where the journey could take us (and already identify meaningful predictors). 
- Look at [this](https://statsguys.wordpress.com/2014/01/03/first-post/) blogpost on how to proceed with the analysis. You can find more "tutorials" [on the kaggle website itself](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/details/new-getting-started-with-r).
- Fork the repo and add your code in your folder so that everyone can have a look at it. This way we´ll learn best :)
- Have a look at decicision trees, random forests and whatever other cool tools/concepts that might help solve the problem. 

We will have the next skype call by beginning of may. By then, we should be familiar with the problem, the data and have performed some exploratory data analysis. 
We will then compare our plots etc. and talk about the next steps which will be data cleaning and the actual data analysis.

Feel free to edit the document and add more interesting links and hints :)
